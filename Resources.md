## R Textbooks 
* [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) is an incredible introductory text regardless of discipline. Mastering the tools in the book will give you the tools to approach most analytic problems. (Note - no regression)

* [Using R for Introductory Econometrics](http://www.urfie.net/) is a companion book to Wooldridge's introductory econometrics book. It doesn't rely on the tidyverse, so it may be a confusing sequel to R4DS, but it is a useful reference for econometric techniques.

* [Principles of Econometrics with R](https://bookdown.org/ccolonescu/RPoE4/) by Constantin Colonescu (2016)

* [Using R for Introductory Econometrics](http://www.urfie.net/) by Florian Heiss (website, print book also available). A good way to learn a language is to walk through something you already know but with the new language. Heiss' book follows baby Wooldridge, but in R.

* [Introduction to Econometrics with R](https://www.econometrics-with-r.org/) is a great tool, especially if you're coming from a Stata background.


## Online curriculums / courses

* [Prof. Soledad Prillaman teaching materials](https://www.soledadprillaman.com/teaching-materials) - includes R and Stata code for the same output

* [Data Science for Economists](https://github.com/uo-ec607/lectures) by Grant McDermott (University of Oregon). Course material includes lectures on [R language basics](https://raw.githack.com/uo-ec607/lectures/master/04-rlang/04-rlang.html) (written with Stata users in mind), and [regression in R overview](https://raw.githack.com/uo-ec607/lectures/master/08-regression/08-regression.html).

* [PhD Econometrics](https://github.com/edrubin/EC525S19) by Ed Rubin (University of Oregon). PhD course taught in the "Mostly Harmless" tradition with full lecture and lab notes available.

* [Guide to R for SCU Economics Students](https://rpubs.com/wsundstrom/home) by William A. Sundstrom (website) - An introduction to R with an economics focus.

* [Data integrity tests in R and Stata](http://www.nickeubank.com/data-integrity-tests-r/) by Nick Eubank - includes guidance on how, when, why to use data integrity tests (e.g. after merge). Website also includes [guidance on doing GIS in R](http://www.nickeubank.com/gis-in-r/).


## For Stata Users
* [R for Stata User](https://www.amazon.com/R-Stata-Users-Statistics-Computing/dp/1441913173) by Muenchen & Hilbe (book) - good for the basics, not for complex regressions or balance tables (you can also find online PDF versions of this instead of buying)

* [Stata 2 R Dictionary](https://github.com/EconometricsBySimulation/RStata/wiki/Dictionary:-Stata-to-R)

* [R for Stata Users](https://www.matthieugomez.com/statar/index.html) by Matthieu Gomez (website)

* [Getting Started in R~Stata](https://dss.princeton.edu/training/RStata.pdf) by Oscar Torres-Reyna (Princeton) - slidedeck comparing Stata and R data exploration techniques

* [Another R-Stata dictionary](http://www.torsten-heinrich.com/blog/R-Stata.pdf) by Torsten Heinrich - pretty extensive looking, haven't used myself

## Packages
* [Stargazer](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stargazer/stargazer.pdf) - package for clean publication-ready Latex tables - see also Jake Russ's [stargazer cheatsheet webpage](https://www.jakeruss.com/cheatsheets/stargazer/)

* [Packages for Loading Data in R](http://nickchk.com/econometrics.html#Rdata) by Nick Huntington-Klein (website) - A list of packages for downloading / importing data from sources commonly used by economists.


## Other

* [RStudio cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) - includes printable colored "cheatsheets" for several commonly used libraries. 

* [Some good introductory machine learning resources in R](https://modernstatisticalworkflow.blogspot.com/2018/01/some-good-introductory-machine-learning.html) by Jim Savage (website). Welcome to the future y'all.

* The [CRAN task view for econometrics](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Econometrics.html) is thorough. CRAN task views are an essential resource for domain-specific R. 

* The Urban Institute has its own website for reference and sharing code called [R Programming at the Urban Institute](https://ui-research.github.io/r-at-urban/). It doesn't contain a lot of information about modeling, but it's useful for our research assistants. We're adding more content all of the time! We'll probably add some modeling information in the future. Requests and pull requests welcome!

* [Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/) is a great place to start. It begins with an introduction to the most common spatial data types, covers operations in the burgeoning sf package, and even extends to modeling and cross validation in mlr. My sense is that many people favor R for the visualization and analysis of spatial data. 

* Finally, the R community is amazing. #rstats on twitter is a useful resource! So are local user groups!
